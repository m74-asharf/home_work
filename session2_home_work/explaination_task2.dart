// 2. Describe the difference between var, dynamic, and explicitly typed variables in Dart.

// var => once assigned, you can not assign a value of a different data type
// dynamic => can assign any type of value and reassign to a different type after that
// Explicity typed => programmer declared the type himself and can only store values of the same type
